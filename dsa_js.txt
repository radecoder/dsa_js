🔷 Key topics to revise/learn:

Variables: let, const, scopes.

Data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, array.

Functions: declaration, arrow functions, parameters & return.

Loops: for, while, for..of, for..in.

Arrays & Objects: creation, manipulation, iteration.

ES6+ features: map, filter, reduce, Set, Map.

Recursion basics.

🚀 Phase 2: Learn Big-O and DSA Basics
You need to understand how to analyze the performance of your code and why one solution is better than another.

🔷 Topics:

Big-O Notation: O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²), etc.

🚀 Phase 3: Master Core Data Structures
Here you’ll learn how to create and use common data structures.

🎯 Suggested Timeline:
Phase	Duration
Basics of JS	1–2 weeks
Big-O & DSA Basics	2–3 days
Data Structures	3–4 weeks

🔷 What is Big-O Notation?
Big-O is a way to measure how fast (or slow) your algorithm grows as the input size increases.

It describes:
✅ the worst-case performance
✅ in terms of operations, not actual time.
✅ independent of your machine or programming language.

🎯 Why do we care?
If two people solve the same problem but:

one takes 10 steps

and another takes 1,000,000 steps for large inputs
…you’d obviously prefer the faster one!

🚀 Common Big-O Complexities:
Complexity	   Name	       Example
O(1)	      Constant      Time	Accessing arr[0]
O(log n)	 Logarithmic	Binary Search
O(n)	     Linear     	Loop through array
O(n log n)   Linearithmic	Merge Sort
O(n²)	     Quadratic	    Nested loops
O(2ⁿ)	     Exponential	Recursive Fibonacci
O(n!)	     Factorial	    Solving Traveling Salesman

📋 Examples:
✅ Constant Time – O(1)

let arr = [1,2,3];
console.log(arr[0]);  // always 1 step
✅ Linear Time – O(n)

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
Time grows linearly with the size of arr.

✅ Quadratic Time – O(n²)

let arr = [1,2,3];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
        console.log(arr[i], arr[j]);
    }
}
If n = 3, you make 3×3 = 9 steps.

📈 Visualization:
Input Size (n)	O(1)	O(log n)	O(n)	O(n²)
n = 10	1	~3	10	100
n = 100	1	~7	100	10,000
n = 1000	1	~10	1000	1,000,000

Clearly, lower complexities scale much better for large n.

🔷 Rules of Thumb:
✅ Drop constants → O(2n) → O(n)
✅ Drop less significant terms → O(n² + n) → O(n²)
✅ Focus on largest term.

🧪 Your Task:
Here are some examples — tell me the Big-O of each:


// 1
console.log(arr[0]);

// 2
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}

// 3
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
        console.log(arr[i], arr[j]);
    }
}

🎯 💯 Perfect answers!

✅ Your answers:

Code	Your Answer	Correct?
console.log(arr[0])	O(1)	✅ Yes — Constant
Single for loop	O(n)	✅ Yes — Linear
Nested for loops	O(n²)	✅ Yes — Quadratic

🌟 Recap:
1️⃣ console.log(arr[0]);

Always 1 step, regardless of array size → O(1)

2️⃣ Single loop:


for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
Iterates through all n elements → O(n)

3️⃣ Nested loops:


for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
        console.log(arr[i], arr[j]);
    }
}
Outer loop: n steps

Inner loop (for each outer iteration): n steps

Total: n × n = n² → O(n²)

🧪 Optional Challenge:
What’s the time complexity of this?


for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
        console.log(arr[i], j);
    }
}
Take a guess and tell me — and if you’re ready, we can start learning your first data structure: Arrays in depth 🚀

📋 Analysis:
✅ Outer loop: runs n times → O(n)
✅ Inner loop: runs 100 times → but 100 is a constant!

So the inner loop takes constant time, no matter how big n becomes.
We ignore constants when writing Big-O.

🔷 Total Steps:
Outer × Inner → n × 100 = 100n

But constants are dropped → ✅ O(n)

✅ Final Answer:
✨ This is O(n), not O(n²).

🪄 Rule to Remember:
If one of the loops does NOT depend on n (input size), its cost is constant and doesn’t make it quadratic.

👏 Good work spotting the structure though!
