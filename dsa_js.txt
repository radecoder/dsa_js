📍 Step-by-Step Plan
🚀 Phase 1: Build the Basics of JavaScript
Before diving into DSA, ensure your JavaScript fundamentals are strong, because you’ll use those to implement algorithms.

🔷 Key topics to revise/learn:

Variables: let, const, scopes.

Data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, array.

Functions: declaration, arrow functions, parameters & return.

Loops: for, while, for..of, for..in.

Arrays & Objects: creation, manipulation, iteration.

ES6+ features: map, filter, reduce, Set, Map.

Recursion basics.

Time: 📅 1–2 weeks

🚀 Phase 2: Learn Big-O and DSA Basics
You need to understand how to analyze the performance of your code and why one solution is better than another.

🔷 Topics:

Big-O Notation: O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²), etc.

Space vs. Time complexity.

How to analyze loops & nested loops.

🚀 Phase 3: Master Core Data Structures
Here you’ll learn how to create and use common data structures.

Data Structure	What to Learn
Array	Basics, operations (insert, delete, search), built-in JS methods
String	Immutability, manipulation, common patterns
Stack	LIFO, implementation (array/object)
Queue	FIFO, types (circular, deque, priority queue)
Linked List	Singly, doubly, operations
Hash Table/Map	Collisions, implementation, use-cases
Set	Uniqueness, operations
Tree	Binary Tree, BST, traversals (DFS, BFS)
Graph	Representation (adjacency list/matrix), traversal (DFS, BFS)
Heap/Priority Queue	Basics, min-heap & max-heap

🚀 Phase 4: Learn Key Algorithms
You’ll now implement and practice classic algorithms.

Algorithm Type	Examples
Sorting	Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
Searching	Linear Search, Binary Search
Recursion	Factorial, Fibonacci, Backtracking
Dynamic Programming	Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence
Graph Algorithms	Dijkstra’s, Prim’s, Kruskal’s
Greedy Algorithms	Activity selection, Huffman coding

🚀 Phase 5: Practice Patterns
Once you know the basics, learn problem-solving patterns to crack harder problems:
✅ Sliding Window
✅ Two Pointers
✅ Fast & Slow Pointers
✅ Backtracking
✅ Divide & Conquer
✅ Dynamic Programming

🚀 Phase 6: Practice, Practice, Practice
🧑‍💻 Solve at least 200–300 problems over time on platforms like:

LeetCode

HackerRank

CodeSignal

Codewars

🎯 Suggested Timeline:
Phase	Duration
Basics of JS	1–2 weeks
Big-O & DSA Basics	2–3 days
Data Structures	3–4 weeks
Algorithms	3–4 weeks
Patterns & Practice	Ongoing
